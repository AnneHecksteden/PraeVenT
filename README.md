Forecasting football injuries by combining screening, monitoring and machine learning

This repository contains supplementary material for the manuscript entitled: Forecasting football injuries by combining screening, monitoring and machine learning.
Specifically reproducible code in R Markdown files (1/2: data preparation and feature engineering; 2/2: data analysis). Both Markdown files are provided 
in executable and knit versions, respectively. 

Upsampled training sets and the trained models are also provided. Please note that sharing raw (non-upsampled) data is not possible due to the difficulty of 
effective anonymization and lack of consent.
